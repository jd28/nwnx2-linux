[RESOURCEMANAGER]
; Logs any files that aren't found internally or in resource handlers.
; These can potentially leak memory.
; Default: 0.
warn_missing = 0;
; If set to 1, resources will hook CRes's constructor and destructor.
; This can be useful for debugging resource issues.
; Default: 0.
debug_cres = 0;
; Source path is the directory resman attempts to read
; files from.  The directory structure must be:
; <SourcePath>/<resource file extension>/<resource file>
SourcePath = resman

; A comma separated list of NWN resource file extensions.
; This will cause all files with these extensions to be cached.
; The file extensions are case insensitive.
; Note: ncs files are always cached.
cache=utc,dlg

; Sets the maximum amount of memory for resman to use.
; A setting of 0 means resman can use as much as it likes.
; This isn't a hard limit but rather a suggestion.
